# Spotify-IS3240-Advanced-Python

The project aims to perform Python data processing techniques including data collection, cleansing, analytics, visualization on the dataset, and try to formulate a satisfying machine learning model to predict the popularity of newly released mini albums (Single & EP). 

We saw the Random Forest got the best performance among all the models and it is most effective to predict album popularity. Additionally, thereâ€™s also some difficulties in this process such as limited data selection and subjective human preferences.
